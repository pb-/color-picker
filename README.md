# color-picker

[Show me](https://baecher.dev/tools/color-picker/index.html).

An HSL color picker. It has a few features that I am often missing with the color picker of the day:

 * Switch between the planes (HS, HL, SL) of HSL for picking a color
 * Render all text/background combinations of picked colors at a glance
 * Display CSS3 color variables ready for copy/paste
